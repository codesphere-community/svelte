## Story:
Svelte is a JavaScript framework. Svelte shifts much of the work to the build step, resulting in highly optimized and efficient code.

## Expectation:
Create a standalone Svelte template with a basic use case (not the standard template from svelte).  This template should be deployable on a Codesphere workspace by only using the ci-pipeline. Write a blog article on any platform you prefer e.g. Dev.To, Medium, Personal Blog) about this template

## Required components:
1 workspace (Svelte)

## Payout
50 â‚¬
